# Collection Tracker
v0.1.0  
  
Are you an avid collector? You like to jam loot in a stash and just let it collect dust as the memory of it fades?  
  
Imagine this horrible scenario:  
You're out on the field. You have some important stuff on you. Almost encumbered.  
You fight a group of enemies and find some incredible looking equipment. Then you start to wonder.  
- Do I already have this at home?
- I should just take it in case I need it for my collection.
- Damn I'm too encumbered. Nevermind let's just walk home nice and slow.

Then you get home open up your trusty/dusty stash and realize that all the items you painstakingly carried for your collection are already present.  
Well no more!  

With this mod you can right click any weapon/armor and either log it into your collection or remove from it.  
When you're out on the field and unsure if you have an item you can just take out your PDA.  
**Guide -> Notes -> Equipment Inventory.**  
Here you see all of your collection items that you've taken an inventory for previously.

# Features
- Saving game saves your registered inventory entries.
- Selling an item (yes it's impossible to sell a weapon/BLACK MARKET) will automatically delete the entry for you.
- Dropping an item will mark the entry for deletion. If you don't pick it up and leave the map the entry will automatically be deleted for you.
- Putting stuff in a stash. If you taken inventory of it then it will be safe even on map changes etc.
- You can right click stuff even if it's in your stashes and it will get registered into the collection.
- Disassembling an item will automatically delete the entry for you after a map change.

# Planned features
- Disassembly: Honestly this might actually delete the inventory entry at some point. Will further test it.
- Batch inventory taking: You'll be able to just take an inventory not of a whole stash of stuff with just the click of 1-2 buttons.
- Duplicate item types will not be registered??? I'll think about best approach here. Maybe you want to overwrite it.
- An image for the PDA notes part.
- Putting on a scope/taking it off will delete the inventory entry (Attaching/Detaching scopes spawn in a new gun. This is a known thing since ages.)
- PDA notification when you take an item that's registered in your collection inventory???
- **MCM options**:
  - **Lean entries**: The inventory entries won't contain the parts and conditions of the object.
  - **Delete all data**: Deletes all saved entry data (accross saves)
  - **Dele data**: Deletes all saved entry data (for current save only)
